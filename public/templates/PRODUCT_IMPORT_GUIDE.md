## üì∏ IMAGE SCAN METHOD

### Photo Guidelines for Best Results

#### ‚ú® Lighting & Quality
- Use good lighting - natural daylight is best
- Avoid shadows on the product label
- Ensure text is clearly visible and not blurry
- Use high resolution (at least 1080p)
- Ensure the image is in focus
- Avoid reflections on glossy packaging
- Clean the camera lens before taking photos

#### üìê Positioning & Content
- Hold the camera steady to avoid blur
- Position the product label facing the camera
- Fill most of the frame with the product
- Keep the camera parallel to the label for best text recognition
- Capture the front label with product name clearly visible
- Include nutritional information panel if available
- Show barcode if present
- Capture expiry date if visible on packaging

### What AI Can Extract

| Information Type | Description | Tips |
|------------------|-------------|------|
| **Product Name** | Main product name from label | Usually the largest text on package |
| **Brand** | Brand or manufacturer name | Often appears as logo or prominent text |
| **Category** | Product category (AI suggested) | Determined by product appearance and text |
| **Weight/Size** | Product weight, volume, or quantity | Look for ml, L, g, kg, oz, pieces |
| **Price** | Product price if visible | May appear as stickers or printed price |
| **Barcode** | Product barcode number | Usually 12-13 digits on back or side |
| **Expiry Date** | Best before or expiry date | Look for 'EXP', 'Best Before', 'Use By' |
| **Origin** | Country of origin | Look for 'Made in', 'Product of' |
| **Halal Certification** | Halal certification logos | Look for JAKIM, MUI, or other halal logos |

### Image Scan Steps

1. **Read Guidelines**: Review photo tips for best results
2. **Take Photo**: Use "Take Photo" or "Upload Image"
3. **AI Processing**: Wait for AI to extract information
4. **Review Data**: Check and edit extracted information
5. **Fill Missing**: Add required fields not detected
6. **Save Product**: Confirm to add to inventory

### Common Image Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Problem | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Blurry Text** | AI cannot read unclear text | Retake with better focus and lighting |
| **Poor Lighting** | Dark images affect recognition | Use natural daylight or better lighting |
| **Partial Information** | AI only extracts some details | Take multiple photos from different angles |
| **Wrong Category** | AI suggests incorrect category | Manually select the correct category |
| **Missing Expiry Date** | Date not detected | Look for date stamps, enter manually |
